# Media App Execution Plan (using Astro and Vercel)

## 1. Set up the project structure and testing environment
- [x] Create necessary directories: `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/layouts`, `src/styles`, `tests`
- [x] Set up a basic layout component
- [x] Install and configure Vercel AI SDK
- [x] Set up testing framework (e.g., Jest, Vitest)
- [x] Configure test runners and CI integration

## 2. Design and implement the data model
- [x] Create interfaces for specific media types: Movie, TVShow, Book, Game, Music, Podcast, YouTubeVideo, Weblink
- [x] Implement a common `MediaItem` interface
- [x] Write unit tests for data models and interfaces

## 3. Develop the core components
- [x] Create a `MediaInput` component for adding new items
  - [ ] Implement API integration for fetching media info
  - [ ] Add AI-powered natural language input processing using Vercel AI SDK
- [ ] Implement a `MediaList` component for displaying items
- [ ] Design a `MediaCard` component for individual item display
- [ ] Write unit tests for each component
- [ ] Implement integration tests for component interactions

## 4. Implement state management
- [ ] Set up a store (e.g., Nanostores) for managing media items
- [ ] Create actions for adding, updating, and deleting items
- [ ] Write unit tests for store and actions
- [ ] Implement integration tests for state management

## 5. Develop the main pages
- [ ] Create a home page with an overview of media lists
- [ ] Implement a page for adding new media items
- [ ] Design a page for viewing and managing lists
- [ ] Write integration tests for page functionality

## 6. Add sorting functionality
- [ ] Implement sorting options in the `MediaList` component
- [ ] Create a `SortControl` component for user interaction
- [ ] Write unit tests for sorting logic
- [ ] Implement integration tests for sorting functionality

## 7. Implement rating system
- [ ] Add a rating property to the `MediaItem` interface
- [ ] Create a `RatingComponent` for user input
- [ ] Update the `MediaCard` to display ratings
- [ ] Write unit tests for rating logic
- [ ] Implement integration tests for rating functionality

## 8. Integrate external APIs
- [ ] Research and select appropriate APIs for each media type
- [ ] Implement API clients for Movies, TV Shows, Books, Games, Music, and Podcasts
- [ ] Create error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Set up Vercel Edge Config for API key management
- [ ] Write unit tests for API clients
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API interactions

## 9. Implement AI-powered input
- [ ] Set up Vercel AI SDK integration
- [ ] Develop natural language processing for media input
- [ ] Implement batch input functionality (e.g., "All the Harry Potter movies")
- [ ] Create fallback mechanism to use AI when API results are not found
- [ ] Write unit tests for AI-powered input processing
- [ ] Implement integration tests for AI functionality

## 10. Enhance UI/UX
- [ ] Style components and pages using CSS/SCSS
- [ ] Implement responsive design
- [ ] Add transitions and animations for a polished feel
- [ ] Design and implement UI for AI-powered input
- [ ] Write visual regression tests

## 11. Comprehensive testing and refinement
- [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
- [ ] Perform user testing and gather feedback
- [ ] Refine and optimize based on test results
- [ ] Ensure all tests are passing and maintain high code coverage

## 12. Deployment and Vercel-specific optimizations
- [ ] Set up Vercel project and link to the repository
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment settings
- [ ] Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Implement Vercel Edge Functions for API routes if needed
- [ ] Configure Vercel Analytics for monitoring
- [ ] Set up Vercel Preview Deployments for pull requests
- [ ] Deploy the app and ensure everything works in production
- [ ] Configure API keys and AI SDK for production environment
- [ ] Implement smoke tests for production deployment
